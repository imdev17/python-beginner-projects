# Python Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of **basic Python projects** that I built before joining college.  
These projects helped me understand **Python fundamentals, logic building, and small real-world applications**.

Even though they are simple, they represent my **early learning phase** and problem-solving approach.

## Projects Included

### 1. Single Operation Calculator
A simple calculator that performs **basic arithmetic operations** like:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

**Focus:** User input handling and conditional logic.

---

### 2. RoboSpeaker
A Python program that **converts text into speech**.

**Focus:** Using Python libraries for text-to-speech and basic automation.

---

### 3. Cafe Management System
A basic café management system that:
- Displays a menu  
- Takes customer orders  
- Calculates the total bill  

**Focus:** Loops and real-world simulation using Python.

---

### 4. QR Code Generator
Generates **QR codes** for user-provided text or links.

**Focus:** Working with external Python libraries and file handling.

---

### 5. Password Generator
Generates **random and secure passwords** using:
- Alphabets  
- Numbers  
- Special characters  

**Focus:** Randomization and string manipulation.

---

### 6. Random Die
Simulates rolling a **die**, producing random values from 1 to 6.

**Focus:** Random module and basic game logic.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- Standard Python Libraries
- Beginner-level External Libraries (where required)

---

## Purpose of This Repository
- Showcase my **early Python learning journey**
- Practice logical thinking and problem-solving
- Build a foundation for advanced projects

---

## Future Improvements
- Improve code structure and readability
- Add comments and documentation
- Convert some projects into GUI or web-based applications

---

## Note
These projects were created during my **initial learning phase**, so the focus was on understanding concepts rather than optimization or advanced design patterns.
